# Convolutional-Neural-Networks
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are deep learning models for image data. They use filters in convolutional layers to detect features like edges and shapes, capturing spatial patterns. This makes CNNs highly effective for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and facial recognition.
